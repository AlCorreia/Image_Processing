## Detection of bananas based on color and edges

This small project was designed to detect bananas in an image using primarily its color.
Naturally, the techniques are readilly adaptable to other fruits/colors.

The project was developed in Matlab with the Image Processing toolbox.

A thorough report documents the methods and results. The report is in Portuguese, but the images are cool nonetheless.
